# 🏥 Healthcare Data Analysis – Project Summary

## 📌 Project Overview

End-to-end analysis of hospital operational data to understand patient behavior, department performance, payment methods, and waiting time trends. Includes data cleaning, SQL analytics, EDA, and a Streamlit dashboard.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Hospitals handle huge amounts of appointment and patient data, but without proper analysis, it’s hard to identify:

* Peak visit times
* Department load
* No-show patterns
* Payment trends
* Patient demographics

This project aims to convert raw data into actionable insights.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

* Analyze patient visits and operational metrics.
* Identify trends that help improve hospital efficiency.
* Build visual dashboards for easy decision-making.

---

## 📂 Dataset Description

Includes:

* Patient age, gender
* Appointment date 
* Department & doctor
* Payment mode
* Waiting time
* Visit status (Completed/No-show)

---

## 🔧 ELT & Data Cleaning

* Loaded raw CSV using Pandas.
* Cleaned missing values, removed duplicates.
* Standardized date formats.
* Converted time columns into datetime.

---

## 🗄 Data Migration

* Moved cleaned datasets into SQL tables.

---

## 🧮 SQL Insights

Key SQL analyses:

* Top departments by visits
* Monthly/weekly appointment trends
* Payment method distribution
* No-show behavior
* Avg waiting time by department

---

## 📊 EDA Summary

Visualized:

* Gender distribution
* Age group trends
* Department performance
* Peak hours
* Payment preferences
* No-show vs completed visits

---

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering

Derived useful variables:

* Time-based (day, month, hour)
* Age groups
* Waiting-time categories
* Visit duration

---

## 💻 Streamlit Dashboard

Built a multi-page dashboard with:

* Key metrics (total visits, no-show rate, revenue)
* Filters (department, date, gender)
* Department analysis
* Payment insights
* Time trend plots

---

## 📈 Key Insights

* General Medicine & Pediatrics had the most visits.
* No-shows increased when waiting time was high.
* Digital payments dominated.
* Visits peaked in mornings and early afternoons.

---

## 📌 Conclusion

The project reveals operational inefficiencies and patient behavior insights that can help hospitals improve service quality and resource planning.
